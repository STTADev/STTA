# STTA
The project for STTA, or Shifting through the Ages.

It's currently unknown what this will use at this point in time, but we'll figure it out soon.

Welcome to Shifting through the Ages.
Project is developed by
Rain, the lead in-game game developer, and the idea
Michael(theShifter), the lead C# developer, who makes the menus and stuff, 
astro, for a handful of the designs, and
lempamo, who is a C# developer and may only be temporary.

It's recommended that you read this document before launching the game.

EULA
1a. Payments
  STTA is a free indie game. You should not have paid money for STTA. If you have, get a refund. The official STTA is downloaded at github.com/STTADev/STTA, but it will likely change very soon. It may be changed to getshiftos.ml. We aren't sure though.
  
1b. Privacy
  Your privacy is yours. We do not share your email, password, age, or anything like that.
  
1c. idk yet
  idk why i am doing this, oh yeah, to provide an example until it is finished.
  
This isn't finished yet, so can a dev lend a hand for this?
