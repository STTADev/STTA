# STTA
The project for STTA, or Shifting through the Ages.

Welcome to Shifting through the Ages.
Project is developed by
Rain, the lead in-game game developer, and the idea
Michael(theShifter), the lead C# developer, who makes the menus and stuff, 
astro, for a handful of the designs, and
lempamo, who is a C# developer and may only be temporary.

It's recommended that you read this document before launching the game.

This isn't finished yet, so can a dev lend a hand for this?
